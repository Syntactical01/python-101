# =================================================================================================
# 
#  Purpose: This program computes the federal tax paid by several different
#           people based on their income and corresponding tax bracket.
#           For convenience we will just assume that people pay a certain percentage
#           based on their salary and we will NOT implement the bracket tax system
#           the USA uses. (You can do this in the future for extra practice).
#
#  Reference slides from the presentation:
#       - ** All slides used by the last problem: `2_simple_taxes` **
#       - Exceptions:       16
#       - Lists:            25
#       - For Loops:        26-29
#       - Dictionaries:     33-35

#
#  Input : State of residence of the user stored as the variable `state`
#          Base salary of the user stored as `base_salary`. 
# 
#  Output : Tax amount the person has to pay.

        #
        #   John Smith will pay 332.33 in taxes.

        # EXTRAS:
        # CONGRATS, the program is done and should run. Ask questions if you have them or you can
        # look into refactoring the code to address the following edge cases if you have time.
        #   1) Add some more people to SOME_PEOPLE to make sure your program works if we
        #      add more people.
        #   2) What would happen if someones enters a negative salary? Can you fix this?
        #     [slide 13 may be useful as well as 17]
        #   3) Lets say I listed `Bill Gates` twice with two different incomes. Could you combine
        #      all his incomes before calculating his taxes due? [slide 17 & 33 could be helpful]
        #   4) [Much Longer Extra] Could you change the code to find the taxes due using the
        #      actual progressive tax system? https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp
