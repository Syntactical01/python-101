"""
# =================================================================================================
# 
#  Purpose: Implement the most iconic programming problem.
#  As praise to our programming overlords we must print "Hello World"
#  to them and provide them with our name, so they can give us their
#  blessing to become programming gurus.
# 
#  Reference slides from the presentation: 7, 8
#
#  Inputs (what this program should take as inputs from the user) :
#       name: string --> The users name which will be printed in the
#                        hello world statement.
# 
#  Outputs : 
#   A Hello World statement printed to terminal.
#
# =================================================================================================

# TODO 1: Add an `name = input(...)` statement to ask the user for their name,
# the message you display for the input is up to you. A simple one could be
# "Legal Name Please:" but you can write whatever you want (1 line) [slide 8]
# =================================================================================================




# =================================================================================================
# TODO 2: Add a `print(...)` statement to output something along the lines of
# --> "Hello World, my name is John Smith" (1 line) [slide 8]
# =================================================================================================




# =================================================================================================
# CONGRATS on your (potentially first) hello world python program.
#
# EXTRAS: If you finish early here are some extra things you can do you get more familiar
# with the content so far:
#
#   1) Add prints in different spots in the program (before and after the input for example)
#      to get more familiar with the `print` function/statement. It will be one of the most
#      used statements you will use. [slide 8]
#
#   2) Add an input for a user to input where they are from (country, state, city, etc.) and
#      print them out. [slide 8]
#
#   3) Play around with the arithmetic to try to do some basic math. [slide 7]
#
#   4) What happens if you take a number from a user `input` and try to do math on it?
#       It will probably error out. We will explain why happened shortly. [slide 7 & 8]
