# Imports should be done in this order:

# Built In - packages that python knows of without any other work
import json
import os
import collections
from collections import namedtuple

# 3rd Party - packages installed with pip
import requests
import boto3

# Owned - file that python can see in our same directory
from file_in_this_dir import my_var
